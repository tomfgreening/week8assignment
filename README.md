Planning!

--Start with the database fo sho! Draw out your tables in words. [Create the schema! Write the SQL to create your tables!] Consideration: foreign/primary keys, data types

--Wireframe time! Low-fidelity wireframes for each part of your app Consider wireframing for a mobile-first strategy

--Break up your tasks into 20ish minute chunks, then have a little break.

--Lock in you MVP features early! Rewrite the MVP features from the assignment requirements? What are the smallest building blocks of each different feature, start by implementing those!

Main requirements: -Routes! static ones AND dynamic ones. ^ building blocks would be configuring your routes to match your plan. -Rendering DB data. ^ configure you DB connection ^Test your DB connection, seed? postman? -Sending data to the DB ^ configure you DB connection ^Test your DB connection, seed? postman? ^create a very basic form with one input for testing
