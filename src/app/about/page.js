      Founded by Jake Kelly, a Brighton-based vegan DJ, our restaurant is more
      than just a dining experience â€“ itâ€™s a celebration of flavour, community,
      and sustainability. Jake has been a fixture of Brightonâ€™s vibrant music
      scene for years, spinning tracks that bring people together. His journey
      into veganism was inspired by his love for animals, the planet, and a
      desire to lead a kinder, more conscious life.
      <br />

      Now, heâ€™s combining his culinary passion with his musical roots to create
